|c|☆Sw33tR0llThief|aight

|c|☆Old_Man_Waffles|aka if hax happen play fresh from there

|c|☆Old_Man_Waffles|cool ill keep this tab open, just resend after you level them up to 100!

|c|☆Old_Man_Waffles|keeping it open so we remember our moves

|c|☆Old_Man_Waffles|my roommate totally questioned why that knock off did so much lol

|c|☆Old_Man_Waffles|more observant than me

|c| H2owsome|yea i was wondering why pursuit did so little

|c| H2owsome|i know bannete is stupid strong
